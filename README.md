# Simple-trajectory-algorithm



Simple trajectory algorithms are implemented in python

Due to my limited English, so there may be grammatical or semantic errors in the description.If you find any errors in the code or description, please contact me for modification.Thank you very much.

This is my email address: taoxu22@mails.jlu.edu.cn

I will upload the algorithms and codes I have learned one after another and add simple comments for reading and understanding.

This library is mainly used to implement breadth-first algorithm, Dijkstra algorithm and Astar algorithm, and visualize their results.

This library is mainly used to record my learning trajectory algorithm process, mainly using python to chieve the algorithm.

If I have extra time, I try to refactor the algorithms in c++ code.

First version of breadth-first algorithm.You need to manually add obstacles.And can only move in four directions.
